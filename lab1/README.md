# Lab 1: Introduction and Docker-Based Deployment

This lab introduces Dynamo and guides you through setting up a Docker-based aggregated deployment.

## Objectives

- Set up the Dynamo environment
- Deploy Dynamo using Docker-based aggregated deployment
- Configure a backend engine (vLLM, SGLang, or TensorRT-LLM)
- Benchmark the deployment using AI-Perf

## Files

- `lab1-introduction-setup.ipynb` - Main lab notebook

## Prerequisites

- Docker and Docker Compose
- Python 3.10+
- GPU (recommended)
- 16GB+ RAM

## Getting Started

   ```

2. Follow the sections in order

3. Complete exercises at the end

## Expected Outcomes

By the end of this lab, you will have:
- A working local Dynamo deployment
- Understanding of aggregated serving architecture
- Baseline performance benchmarks
- Experience with different backend engines

## Time Estimate

~90 minutes

## Next Lab
