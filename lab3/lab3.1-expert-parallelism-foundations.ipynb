    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "- Dense: 200B parameters → all active per token\n",
    "- MoE: 1T parameters → ~200B active per token (top-k experts)\n",

    "\n",
    "Most production MoE models (DeepSeek-V3, Qwen3, Mixtral) use a **flat expert pool** architecture. Let's understand how it works:\n",

    "    Top-K Selection (e.g., k=8)\n",

    "         ▼\n",
    "   [E₁₂, E₄₅, E₇₈, E₁₂₃, E₁₅₆, E₁₈₉, E₂₀₁, E₂₃₄]\n",
    "         │\n",
    "         ▼\n",
    "   Weighted Sum → Output\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Components:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Router Network**: A small learned neural network that:\n",
    "   - Takes token embedding as input\n",
    "   - Outputs a score for **every expert** in the pool\n",
    "   - Trained end-to-end with the model\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Top-K Selection**: \n",
    "   - Selects the k experts with highest scores\n",
    "   - Only these experts process the token\n",
    "   - Others are completely skipped (sparse activation)\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Weighted Combination**:\n",
    "   - Each selected expert's output is weighted by its score\n",
    "   - Final output = weighted sum of expert outputs\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example: DeepSeek-V3 Configuration\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Total experts**: 256 (flat pool)\n",
    "- **Active per token**: 8 (top-8 selection)\n",
    "- **Activation ratio**: 8/256 = 3.1% of experts per token\n",
    "- **Effective compute**: ~37B parameters active (out of 671B total)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Why \"Flat\" Pool?\n",
    "\n",
    "All 256 experts are:\n",
    "- ✅ Scored simultaneously by the router\n",
    "- ✅ Treated equally (no hierarchy or grouping)\n",
    "- ✅ Can be selected for any token (maximum flexibility)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Contrast with hierarchical** (rare in practice):\n",
    "- ❌ Would have multiple routing stages\n",
    "- ❌ Experts grouped by domain (Language/Reasoning/etc.)\n",

    "- **58 MoE layers** (61 total layers - 3 dense layers)\n",
    "- **256 experts per layer** (each layer has its own expert pool)\n",
    "- **With EP=64**: Each GPU stores 4 experts per layer (256÷64=4)\n",

    "**Key Architectural Points:**\n",
    "- **Total model capacity**: 256 experts/layer × 58 layers = **14,848 total expert weights**\n",
    "- **Sparse activation**: Only 8 experts active per token **per layer** (~37B params active despite 671B total)\n",
    "- **Layer specialization**: Each layer's experts can develop unique knowledge\n",
    "- **Deployment agnostic**: When you use `--ep-size 64`, the framework handles distribution automatically\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why This Matters for Wide-EP:**\n",
    "With 232 experts per GPU vs thousands in a naive deployment, each GPU has:\n",

    "**Naive approach** (slow):\n",
    "- Loop through each token\n",
    "- Load expert weights for that token\n",
    "- Compute matrix multiplication\n",
    "- Repeat 1000 times → **massive weight-loading overhead!**\n",
    "\n",
    "**GroupGEMM approach** (fast):\n",
    "1. **Group**: Collect all tokens going to the same expert\n",
    "2. **Batch**: Pack them into a single large matrix\n",
    "3. **Compute**: One fused matrix multiplication per expert\n",
    "4. **Reuse**: Expert weights loaded once, reused for all tokens\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "GroupGEMM batching:\n",
    "Expert 5:  [150 tokens batched] → Single GEMM operation\n",
    "Expert 12: [200 tokens batched] → Single GEMM operation\n",
    "Expert 27: [100 tokens batched] → Single GEMM operation\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why Wide-EP Improves GroupGEMM Efficiency:**\n",
    "\n",
    "With fewer experts per GPU (e.g., 4 instead of 32):\n",
    "- ✅ **Less weight loading**: Fewer expert weights to manage\n",
    "- ✅ **Better cache hits**: Expert weights stay in on-chip memory/registers longer\n",
    "- ✅ **Higher arithmetic intensity**: More compute (FLOPs) per byte of weight loaded\n",
    "- ✅ **Improved memory/compute balance**: GPUs spend more time computing, less time waiting for weights\n",
