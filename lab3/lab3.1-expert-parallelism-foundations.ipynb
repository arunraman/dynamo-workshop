    "\n",
    "Most production MoE models (DeepSeek-V3, Qwen3, Mixtral) use a **flat expert pool** architecture. Let's understand how it works:\n",

    "    Top-K Selection (e.g., k=8)\n",

    "         │\n",
    "         ▼\n",
    "   Weighted Sum → Output\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Components:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Router Network**: A small learned neural network that:\n",
    "   - Takes token embedding as input\n",
    "   - Outputs a score for **every expert** in the pool\n",
    "   - Trained end-to-end with the model\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Top-K Selection**: \n",
    "   - Selects the k experts with highest scores\n",
    "   - Only these experts process the token\n",
    "   - Others are completely skipped (sparse activation)\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Weighted Combination**:\n",
    "   - Each selected expert's output is weighted by its score\n",
    "   - Final output = weighted sum of expert outputs\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example: DeepSeek-V3 Configuration\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Total experts**: 256 (flat pool)\n",
    "- **Active per token**: 8 (top-8 selection)\n",
    "- **Activation ratio**: 8/256 = 3.1% of experts per token\n",
    "- **Effective compute**: ~37B parameters active (out of 671B total)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Why \"Flat\" Pool?\n",
    "\n",
    "All 256 experts are:\n",
    "- ✅ Scored simultaneously by the router\n",
    "- ✅ Treated equally (no hierarchy or grouping)\n",
    "- ✅ Can be selected for any token (maximum flexibility)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Contrast with hierarchical** (rare in practice):\n",

    "### 8.6 When to Use Wide-EP: Practical Guidance\n",
    "\n",
    "Wide-EP is powerful but not always the right choice. Here's when it makes sense:\n",
    "\n",
    "**✅ Good candidates for Wide-EP:**\n",
    "- **Large MoE models** with many experts (e.g., DeepSeek-R1 with 256 experts)\n",
    "- **Latency-constrained throughput** scenarios (need high tokens/sec at fixed latency)\n",
    "- **High-bandwidth interconnect** available (NVL72, multi-node NVLink clusters)\n",
    "- **Variable workloads** where EPLB can balance load dynamically\n",
    "\n",
    "**❌ When to avoid Wide-EP:**\n",
    "- Small models with few experts (communication overhead dominates)\n",
    "- Low-latency, low-throughput scenarios (overhead not justified)\n",
    "- Limited interconnect bandwidth (communication becomes bottleneck)\n",
    "- Single-node deployments with < 8 GPUs\n",
    "\n",
    "**Integration with NVIDIA Dynamo:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Wide-EP works best when orchestrated by **NVIDIA Dynamo** for disaggregated serving:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Component | Role |\n",
    "|-----------|------|\n",
    "| **NVIDIA Dynamo** | Orchestration: disaggregates prefill/decode, SLA-aware autoscaling, dynamic routing |\n",
    "| **TensorRT-LLM Wide-EP** | Execution: expert-parallel MoE with optimized kernels, FP8, CUDA graphs, EPLB |\n",
    "\n",
    "**Together they enable:**\n",
    "- Prefill pool scales independently from decode pool\n",
    "- Decode pool uses Wide-EP (e.g., EP=64) for throughput\n",
    "- Dynamo Planner adapts to ISL/OSL fluctuations in real-time\n",
    "- EPLB balances expert load within the decode pool\n",
