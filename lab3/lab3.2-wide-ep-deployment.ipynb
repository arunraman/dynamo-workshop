    "### Monitoring Expert Parallelism and EPLB\n",
    "\n",
    "When running MoE models with EP and EPLB, monitoring is crucial to ensure optimal performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Key Metrics to Monitor\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Expert Usage Distribution**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# SGLang automatically logs expert usage statistics\n",
    "# Look for logs like:\n",
    "# \"Expert usage: [0.05, 0.12, 0.03, 0.15, ...]\"\n",
    "# These show the fraction of tokens routed to each expert\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. GPU Utilization per Expert**\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "# Use nvidia-smi to check GPU utilization\n",
    "watch -n 1 nvidia-smi\n",
    "\n",
    "# For detailed metrics, use DCGM:\n",
    "dcgmi dmon -e 155,156,203,204 -d 1\n",
    "# 155 = GPU Utilization\n",
    "# 156 = Memory Utilization\n",
    "# 203 = Tensor Core Utilization\n",
    "# 204 = FP16 Activity\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. EPLB Rebalancing Events**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Enable verbose logging to see EPLB rebalancing\n",
    "# Set environment variable: DYNAMO_LOG=debug\n",
    "\n",
    "# Look for logs like:\n",
    "# \"EPLB: Rebalancing experts after 100 iterations\"\n",
    "# \"EPLB: Expert 5 replicated to GPU 2 (high usage: 0.25)\"\n",
    "# \"EPLB: Expert 17 removed from GPU 3 (low usage: 0.01)\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**4. Network Bandwidth (for Multi-Node)**\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "# Monitor InfiniBand bandwidth\n",
    "ibstat\n",
    "\n",
    "# Monitor network throughput\n",
    "iftop -i ib0  # Replace ib0 with your IB interface\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Troubleshooting Common Issues\n",
    "\n",
    "**Issue 1: Uneven GPU Utilization**\n",
    "```\n",
    "Symptoms:\n",
    "- Some GPUs at 100%, others at <50%\n",
    "- Throughput lower than expected\n",
    "- Long token generation times\n",
    "\n",
    "Solution:\n",
    "- Enable EPLB: --enable-eplb\n",
    "- Increase redundant experts: --ep-num-redundant-experts 32\n",
    "- Adjust rebalancing frequency: --eplb-rebalance-num-iterations 50\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Issue 2: High Memory Usage**\n",
    "```\n",
    "Symptoms:\n",
    "- OOM errors\n",
    "- Cannot create redundant experts\n",
    "\n",
    "Solution:\n",
    "- Reduce memory fraction: --mem-fraction-static 0.80 (from 0.85)\n",
    "- Reduce redundant experts: --ep-num-redundant-experts 16\n",
    "- Disable features: --disable-radix-cache\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Issue 3: Slow Expert All-to-All Communication**\n",
    "```\n",
    "Symptoms:\n",
    "- High latency during expert routing\n",
    "- Low GPU utilization despite balanced load\n",
    "\n",
    "Solution:\n",
    "- Use DeepEP backend: --moe-a2a-backend deepep\n",
    "- Enable two-batch overlap: --enable-two-batch-overlap\n",
    "- Check network: Ensure InfiniBand is active and configured\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Issue 4: EPLB Not Rebalancing**\n",
    "```\n",
    "Symptoms:\n",
    "- No rebalancing logs\n",
    "- Expert usage remains imbalanced over time\n",
    "\n",
    "Solution:\n",
    "- Enable explicit EPLB: --enable-eplb\n",
    "- Use appropriate recorder mode: --expert-distribution-recorder-mode stat\n",
    "- Lower rebalance threshold: --eplb-rebalance-num-iterations 50\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Performance Tuning Tips\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Optimize Memory Allocation**\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "# Start with conservative memory fraction\n",
    "--mem-fraction-static 0.80\n",
    "\n",
    "# Gradually increase if no OOM\n",
    "--mem-fraction-static 0.85\n",
    "\n",
    "# Monitor with nvidia-smi\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Tune Redundant Expert Count**\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "# Formula: redundant_experts ≈ num_GPUs / 2 to num_GPUs\n",
    "# For 32 GPUs: try 16-32 redundant experts\n",
    "\n",
    "# Start low\n",
    "--ep-num-redundant-experts 16\n",
    "\n",
    "# Increase if imbalance persists\n",
    "--ep-num-redundant-experts 32\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. DeepEP Mode Selection**\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "# For prefill (focus on throughput)\n",
    "--deepep-mode normal\n",
    "\n",
    "# For decode (focus on latency)\n",
    "--deepep-mode low_latency\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**4. Batch Size Tuning**\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "# For decode, tune CUDA graph batch size\n",
    "# Larger = better throughput, more memory\n",
    "--cuda-graph-bs 128\n",
    "\n",
    "# If OOM, reduce\n",
    "--cuda-graph-bs 64\n",
