    "**Key Concepts**:\n",
    "- **MoE Models**: Only activate a subset of experts per token (e.g., 8 out of 256 experts)\n",
    "- **Expert Parallelism (EP)**: Distribute experts across GPUs to scale capacity\n",
    "- **Wide EP**: Spread experts across many nodes for maximum throughput\n",
    "- **EPLB**: Dynamic load balancing to prevent GPU hotspots\n",
    "\n",
    "**What you're deploying today:**\n",
    "```\n",
    "DeepSeek-R1 Model:\n",
    "  - 671B total parameters\n",
    "  - 256 experts (distributed via EP)\n",

    "# For detailed metrics, use DCGM:\n",

    "**3. EPLB Rebalancing Events**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Enable verbose logging to see EPLB rebalancing\n",
    "# Set environment variable: DYNAMO_LOG=debug\n",
    "\n",
    "# Look for logs like:\n",
